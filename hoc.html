        <h6> From booking a taxi or ordering food to manufacturing cars or planes, coding plays more and more crucial role in our lives, <br> especially given the current circumstances related to pandemic. <br>Unfortunately, we feel that in Azerbaijan, unlike in other more developed countries, people appreciate the importance <br> of programming much less than they should. Hence, we, students of #ADAUniversity, thought that it is our duty to <br> educate younger generation and decided to organize the #HourOfCode event <br> to introduce them to the World of Coding. <br> The event was held at IB Lyceum and Language School <br> â„–6 on December 11, 16:00. 21 students were participating in the event. We would like to  <br>thank all the students for their active participation, <br> and ADA University for the opportunity to teach children something new. </h6>
