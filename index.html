            <h6>I have been interested in music since the very childhood. I think my grandmother, who is a professional pianist,  <br> contributed to this, she always tried to teach me how to play the piano when I was younger. However,  <br>I started learning to play the piano seriously about 2 years ago. Unfortunately, due to being busy at school,  <br>I could not go to a music school or attend private classes, and therefore I had to learn to play the piano myself.  <br> Nevertheless, playing the piano relaxes me and gives me a lot of pleasure, and it is one of my favorite thing to do at spare time.</h6>
