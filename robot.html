        <h6> Our work with LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robot started with the exploration of the Robot Trainer tutorials. Next, we started writing <br> a program for the robot, taking all the requirements into the consideration. <br> We had to think of all the possible scenarios that may take place, due to the fact that we do not have an  <br>actual robot, so it is impossible to test the program beforehand. After some investigation, we came to the conclusion<br> that robot works by the following principle: robot turns either left <br> or right based on the reflected light <br> intensity, which is measured by the color sensor.</h6>
